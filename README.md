- As a User, I should be able to check the leaderboard that contains the high score with the name of the players.
- As a User, I should have a button to start the game. The game should ask the player to enter his/her name. The game should give 10 random MC questions to the user with 4 options to each question(only one right answer).
- As a User, I want to have a button to move to the next question after answering the current question. The next question button should only appear/activate after answering the question.
- As a User, I should be able to see how many questions I still have to answer(2/10 meaning that I am on the second question).
